# Payday

Yesterday was the payday  
But I didn't want to get my  
Salary  
The reason why I was paid was that I worked  
In other words,  
If I hadn't worked,  
I wouldn't have been paid

I didn't feel that  
I worked for the salary  
I said in my heart,  
"I don't have to be paid this month"  

However,  
I didn't love my job  
I doubted that I could continue  
Working

After all  
I went to the office  
And got the salary statement,  
Remembering my father had often said,  
"Take what you can take"

But in truth,  
I should refrain  
From taking everything  
I can get
